# # Practical 4 - Infection Rate Time Simulation
# # Pseudo-code Planning
# # 1. Define initial infected count, daily growth rate, and total class size
# # 2. Initialize day counter and current infected count
# # 3. Loop: calculate daily new infected count = current infected count * (1 + growth rate)
# # 4. Increment day counter and print daily infection data
# # 5. Stop loop when current infected count >= total class size
# # 6. Print total days required to infect all students

# # Define basic parameters
# initial_infected = 5  # Initial number of infected students
# growth_rate = 0.4     # Daily infection growth rate (40%)
# total_students = 91   # Total number of students in the class

# # Initialize simulation variables
# current_infected = initial_infected
# days = 0

# # Print initial simulation info
# print("IBI1 Class Infection Simulation")
# print(f"Initial infected: {initial_infected}, Daily growth rate: {growth_rate*100}%")
# print("-" * 30)

# # Loop to calculate daily infection numbers
# while current_infected < total_students:
#     days += 1
#     # Update current infected count (rounded to 1 decimal place for realism)
#     current_infected = current_infected * (1 + growth_rate)
#     # Print daily result
#     print(f"Day {days}: Infected students = {current_infected:.1f}")

# # Loop ends, print total days required
